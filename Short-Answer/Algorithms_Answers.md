#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) Linear - O(n)
    The number of additional operations the algorithm needs to perform grows in direct proportion to the increace in input size(n) 

b) Exponential - O(n!)
    The number of operations being performed as an exponential function of the input size n. The number of nested loops increases as a function of the input size

c) Constant - O(1)
    The runtime or space used is not affected by the size of the input
