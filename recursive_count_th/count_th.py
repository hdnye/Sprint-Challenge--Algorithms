'''
Your function should take in a single parameter (a string `word`)
Your function should return a count of how many occurences of ***"th"*** occur within `word`. Case matters.
Your function must utilize recursion. It cannot contain any loops.
'''
def count_th(word):
    # Start count of occurences of 'th'
    # count = 0
    # TBC
    # identify the target
    target = 'th'
    # search for the target 
    count = word.count(target)
    # increase the counter                 
    # return count
    count_th(count)
