'''
Your function should take in a single parameter (a string `word`)
Your function should return a count of how many occurences of ***"th"*** occur within `word`. Case matters.
Your function must utilize recursion. It cannot contain any loops.

    # Start count of occurences of 'th'

    if len(word) < 2:
        return 0
    
    # identify the target    
    # count = 0      
    # target = 'th'
    # if word.count(target, 0, -1):
    #     count += 1
    # return count

    # search for the target 
    # total = word.count(target, 0, -1)
    # # increase the counter                 
    # # return total
    # count_th(total)
